Just another repository

Kevin here! I study Economics and Political Science at CU Boulder. Programming, statistics, and data science are all topics that interest me. My hobbies also include basketball (Go Nuggets!), weightlifting, and computer games. R&B, classic rock, and hip-hop are my favorite types of music. I currently plan on pursuing a PhD in statistics after I finish undergrad. I aspire to work in a field related to quantitative finance and data science.
